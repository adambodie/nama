<h1>Clicks</h1>
<p>Khoekhoe has a fairly simple consonant system involving the normal non-clicks, but far more complex are the clicks. There are four types of articulation and five different accopaniment types.  Clicks are produced with two points of closure of the tongue, instead of one as non-clicks are formed. When making a click, the air is drawn inward instead of outward. Beach (1938:89) found that clicks have four types of articulation with five different accompaniment types. Clicks appear only at the beginning of the root and are always followed by a vowel or diphthong, with the exception of neutral vowel.</p>
