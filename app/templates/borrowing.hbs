<h1>Borrowing</h1>
<p>It is easy to determine which words in Nama are native and which ones are borrowed.  Some phonemes are exclusive to foreign words, including /c/, /f/, /v/.  The /c/ phoneme is used to translate biblical German words, one of the main languages Nama borrows from.  Another language Nama borrows from is Afrikaans.  The fricatives /f/ and /v/ are used for proper names in Afrikaans and German. <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#accordion" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Beach 1938:64">[1]</a></sup></p>
